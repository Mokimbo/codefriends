# Java script arrays
Things learned 
1. arrays start at 0 instead of 1
2. push adds the the back of the array while unshift adds to the front
3. you can use variables as indexes
Questions
- can you reorder things you add in an array
- how would you use arrays in your code
- how does an array being inside another array work for indexes as variables
# Java script loops
Things learned
1. you can loop infinitely if you're not careful
2. for loops are the most common
3. you can iterate over arrays to do the same thing to each entry in an array
Questions
- can you use || in a loop so that the code will repeat until one of the correct values is chosen
- when itterating over an array, does it use the variable of the array or what the index is itself
- how would you go about resetting a loop?
